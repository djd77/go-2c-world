                Brazil encompasses around half of South America's landmass, making it the 
                largest country on the continent. Because it's so large, it's not surprising 
                that it is made up of a wide variety of landscapes, coastlines, and 
                experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wildlife lovers can explore the wetlands and the rainforest, while city 
                lovers can wander the streets of Rio. Along with beautiful beaches, one 
                of the world's best soccer teams, and the world-famous Carnival celebration; 
                Brazil is truly a melting pot, perfect for every kind of traveler.

            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>The official language of Brazil is Portuguese. Not many people outside of 
                the tourism industry speak English so it would be a good idea to brush up 
                on some basics before you go.
            </p>
            <h3>Currency</h3>
            <p>
                The official currency of Brazil is the Real (BRL).
            </p>
            <h3>Banking</h3>
            <p>
                Credit cards are widely accepted in major cities and large stores in Brazil.
                Small businesses, cafes, markets, and stores that are outside cities 
                will usually only accept cash.
            </p>
            <p>
                ATMs are common in major towns and cities but are more difficult 
                to find in the countryside. Many places with ATMs will lock them overnight 
                to prevent vandalism and theft, so ensure you visit during the day to 
                withdraw any cash you need.
            </p>
            <h3>Safety</h3>
            <p>
                Brazil is known for its high crime rates. In general, most crime that affects 
                tourists is typically thefts, muggings and pickpocketing. Safeguard your 
                belongings, avoid traveling alone if possible, and minimise the amount of
                expensive or 'flashy' jewelery and accessories you wear. Following these 
                basic safety steps to keep yourself safe can alleviate most of the risk.
